<h1>You Do VooDoo</h1>


<p><em>The bayous of Lousiana are odd places. Not quite bodies of water, not quite pieces of land.<br>
They are shrouded in as much mystery as they are shrouded in moss and fog.<br>
The bayous hold secrets that can only be found by those willing to look.<br>
But those discoveries come at a price...especially when wandering into the homes of the voodoo kings and queens.<br>
Such becomes the fate of four friends: Shayma, Ethan, Maya, and Sam, when they stumble upon the artifacts of voudou’s most malicious loa: Kalfou. Kalfou doesn’t take kindly to mortals who mess with him or his things, and he punishes all four with a curse: three to be entrapped within an inescapable realm, and the last with the quest to travel across the worlds to challenge him for the lives of the others.<br>
The first stop are the swampy bayous of Louisiana, but it doesn't stop there. They must travel across the dimensional planes that form the expansive world of voodoo, befriending friendly loa, and utilising their strengths to make their way to Kalfou.<br>
Who knows what lies in store...</em></p>
